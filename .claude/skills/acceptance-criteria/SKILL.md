# Acceptance criteria

A criterion is a statement that a test can prove false. If nobody can say precisely what would make it fail, it is an aspiration, and aspirations cannot gate a merge.

## The format

Each criterion is one line, in the form:

`Given <starting state>, when <action>, then <observable result>.`

Attach to each criterion the check that proves it: a test name or a command. If the criterion is something a user can see, attach both - the check, and where a human looks to confirm it with their own eyes.

Both, rather than either, because each one alone fails in its own direction. A check nobody can see passing sends the reviewer back to reading the diff, which is the thing checks exist to replace. A screen nobody tested regresses quietly, with nothing going red.

## The test

Read the criterion and ask: could two reasonable people disagree about whether it is met? If yes, rewrite it.

Good: "Favorites persist across a tab switch, verified by a test that reloads the page and asserts the list length."

Bad: "Favorites work well."

Good: "An empty favorites list shows the empty state, not a spinner, verified by a component test."

Bad: "Handle the empty case gracefully."

Good: "Given three entries in the content directory, when the page is built, then all three are listed in date order - covered by `lists entries newest first`, and visible as three rows on the entries page."

Bad: "The entries page looks right." Nothing here says what a reviewer would be looking at, so two people can disagree about whether it passed.

## Coverage

Criteria cover the states, not just the happy path. For anything a user touches, that means at least: the normal case, the empty case, and the failure case. An issue whose criteria only describe success is an issue that will ship a broken error path.

Criteria describe behaviour, not implementation. "Uses a reducer" is not a criterion; it is a decision, and it belongs in an ADR.

**A criterion about a built artifact names which build produced it.** "Checked against the built output" sounds rigorous and is not: it says a file was read, not that the file is the one a user gets. A project's own build and the build that publishes it are frequently different programs, and a criterion that does not say which one it means will be satisfied by whichever is convenient. That is not a hypothetical - a repository once proved every criterion against output from a builder that never ran in production, and shipped a site nobody could load.

So write the builder into the criterion: *when built by `<the thing that publishes this>`, then ...*. If the two builds differ and the checkable one is the local one, say that too, and say what covers the gap. A criterion that quietly measures the wrong artifact is worse than a missing one, because it ends the search.

**A criterion that names a value says what the value has to be, not that it is there.** "Then the page contains a link back to the listing", "then the config sets a timeout", "then the response includes a user id" are all satisfied by a value that is present and wrong. The check written from one greps for existence, goes green, and the criterion is ticked - so the reviewer stops looking, which is the whole cost.

Presence is the right shape only when presence is genuinely the requirement - an optional field rendering at all, an element being absent in an empty state. Whenever the thing could be present and still broken, write the correct value into the criterion and let the check assert that: *then the page contains a link to the listing that resolves from the entry's own URL*, not *then the page contains a link*.

The tell is that you can imagine a plausible wrong implementation passing. A repository lost this one twice over in a single objective: a spec said an entry page's "back" link should be a bare relative path, a criterion asked only that the built page "contains a link back to its collection's listing", and the one grep that might have caught it only looked for root-absolute paths. Every criterion would have passed with the link 404ing from every entry page on the site.

## What a criterion costs to satisfy

A criterion is also an instruction to spend a run's budget, and the agent writing it is not the agent paying. Write them knowing that.

The cost is in *setups*, not assertions. A fixture that has to be built, seeded, torn down, or compiled is expensive; another assertion against a fixture that already exists is nearly free. Three criteria each demanding their own build cost roughly three times one criterion demanding a build that three assertions then read - and the observable behaviour proved is identical.

So when several criteria describe the same starting state, say so once: `Given <that state>, when <action>, then <result>, and <result>, and <result>`. Split them only when the starting states genuinely differ.

This is not a licence to ask for less. Nothing about what "done" looks like changes - the same behaviours are still proved, and a criterion that needs its own expensive setup keeps it. What changes is that the issue fits in the budget that has to satisfy it, instead of dying at the turn cap with the work half done and the attempt spent.

If an issue cannot be stated inside its budget even written this way, that is the finding: it is two issues, and saying so costs nothing compared to discovering it from a run that ran out.

## How many

Between two and six per issue. One criterion means the issue is a task and probably belongs inside another issue. More than six means it is two issues wearing a coat.

## Readiness

An issue is ready to start when every criterion is observable, checkable, and covered by a named check. An issue that fails that test does not get worked on - it gets sent back with the specific criterion that needs rewriting quoted in the comment.
